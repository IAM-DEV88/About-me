# Hello! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I am a Systems Technician, Administrative Management Technologist, and a self-taught **<a href="http://platzi.com/p/IAM-DEV88/">certified</a>** programmer. I have experience addressing specific needs for clients, including Educational Institutions, small businesses, and others.

I began my journey by repairing computer labs, took on roles as a substitute English teacher, and an administrative assistant. Along the way, my curiosity led me to grasp basic concepts of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL to create small websites catering to personal needs such as:
- Repair log
- Student attendance control
- English script generator (simple paragraphs)
- Task agenda
- <a href="https://github.com/IAM-DEV88/RIE">Personal accounting control</a>
- [Other developed projects](https://github.com/IAM-DEV88/About-me/blob/main/README.md#other-developed-projects-)

This journey forged self-taught habits where I daily use official reference documentation, videos, and forums in both Spanish and English to enhance and solidify my knowledge.

Thanks to this, I had the opportunity to develop websites for Educational Institutions, small shops, and associations, which I published using services like GoDaddy, Hostinger, among others. Currently, I seize every opportunity to learn more and elevate my developments to a professional level.
